This repository contains two applications of the ARM Neon SIMD.

First is an application of the Newton-Raphson algorithm, as it allows to solve multiple polynomials parallely.

The second is two algorithms of image processing, first is a grey-filter and the second Laplace-Filter. 

(Laplace filter is unfinished).
